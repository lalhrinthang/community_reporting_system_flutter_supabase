Urban residents in Yangon face frequent safety hazards such as fires, floods, accidents, and sudden security checkpoints.  
Due to internet blackouts, political instability, and personal safety risks, citizens lack access to timely and trustworthy local safety information.  Existing reporting platforms often require personal identification and constant connectivity, which can expose users to surveillance and retaliation.  

This project proposes an offline-first, anonymous community reporting system that enables users to share real-time safety information without revealing personal identity. The system prioritizes user privacy, resilience during network disruptions, and ethical, non-political usage.
